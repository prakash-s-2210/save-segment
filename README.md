# save-segment
This project involves creating a page that allows users to save a segment by clicking on a "Save segment" button. When the button is clicked, a popup appears that includes a text box for the user to enter the segment name and a dropdown menu titled "Add schema to segment". The dropdown menu has pre-defined options such as first name, last name, gender, age, account name, city, and state, each with a corresponding value.

Additionally, there is a link labeled "+Add new schema" that, when clicked, adds a new dropdown to the blue box. The newly added dropdown can be changed, and it should have options that are not yet selected. Once the new dropdown is added, the "Add schema to segment" dropdown should reset and have unselected options.

Overall, this project is aimed at creating a user-friendly interface for saving segments in a convenient and organized manner.
